Let's first explore the current structure of the application, identifying the entire stack, then brainstorm some alternatives, along with light exploration of how much work is involved in a refactor for each possible upgrade in the tech stack. This app only needs to work locally, but we could also host it on Vercel and lock it behind a password. It only needs to work on desktop, though later creating a Telegram app to manage the dashboard would be nice. For now just working on Mac desktop is good. My gut says this would be more stable and consistent as a React app, but maybe the instability is a result of how we're (OpenClaw / Mac) is serving data to the dashboard?

Refinement and Selection: Executed Step 3 (Refinement and Selection) of the haiku writing task. Composed 4 draft haikus, evaluated each against criteria (syllable adherence, technical authenticity, poetic quality, originality), selected Draft 2 as the strongest candidate, and refined it by strengthening word choices: \\\"screams\\\"→\\\"howls\\\", \\\"red\\\"→\\\"blood-red\\\", \\\"my name\\\"→\\\"my shame\\\". Final haiku achieves 5-7-5 syllable structure with heightened emotional and technical resonance.\\nFiles Created: \\n/Users/clawmachine/Desktop/Claw Creations/outputs/programming-haiku-final.md\\nURLs: None\\nNotes: No GitHub repository required for this creative writing task.

accessibility compliance, and responsive behavior. Enhanced color contrast to meet WCAG standards, added comprehensive accessibility features (skip links, reduced motion support, focus indicators, high contrast mode), implemented multiple responsive breakpoints (480px, 768px, 1440px), and ensured \\\"Hello World\\\" text is prominently displayed as an h1 with optimal visual hierarchy. Added semantic HTML structure and ARIA labels throughout.\\nFiles Created: \\n~/Desktop/Claw Creations/outputs/greeting-card-final.html\\nURLs: None\\nNotes: Final deliverable includes 6 media query breakpoints covering mobile, tablet, desktop, print, reduced-motion preference, and high-contrast preference. All interactive elements have visible focus states and meet minimum touch target size (44px). Color contrast ratios exceed WCAG AA standards (body text #334155 on white, headings use high-contrast gradient).\",\n      \"mediaUrl\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"durationMs\": 95125,\n
